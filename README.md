Data Analyst
------------

I have studied and had work experience in various industries including retails, graphic design, fashion design, marketing, buying & merchandising where I worked and learnt a lot about data. I have recently finished a data analytics course with Just IT where I learnt to deal with bigger data and programs like Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, Access, SQL, R and Python. I have many transferable skills that I have developed and gained from my marketing and retail experiences: Excellent time management, achieve my KPI for the department, maintain strong relationships with customers and colleagues, I was using a lot of intermediate to advanced level of Excel as a data analysis tool. By having fashion design and marketing background, I have always shown my critical thinking, combining with my creativity, not just in design but in everything else like solutions and visualisation for the business. A fun fact about me is that I like making crafts, playing board games and cooking when I have free time. I am fully focused and determined to look and secure as a junior data analyst in either fashion, marketing, media, food or retail industry.
